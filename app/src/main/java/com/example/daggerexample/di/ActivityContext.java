 * @Qualifier annotation is provided by javax inject package and is used to qualify the dependency.
 * For example, a class can ask both, an Application Context and an Activity Context.
 * But both these Objects will be of type Context. So, for Dagger to figure out which variable is
 * to be provided with what, we have to explicitly specify the identifier for it.
